This is my bad Gentoo overlay.  It kills kittens, threatens babies, and even juliennes.

It's a repo for whatever DFIR packages I feel like packaging that are either not up to my wishes upstream or are languishing.  Sometimes this requires packaging a lot more than the origin package to do it right.
